        <p>I wanted to hone my MySQL and express.js skills, so I developed this project.
            I built this database, using MySQL Workbench and Amazon Web Services (AWS).
            I built the front-end with HTML, CSS, and Javascript, and I built the server using Express.js and Node.
        </p>
        <p>I grew up in the heyday of 90s Nickelodeon.
            I collect classic Nickelodeon VHS releases. This database is a catalogue of my collection. In the search bar, enter a keyword like a show title, release date, or character to view
            relevant tapes in my collection. To view all tapes in my collection, enter the search term "select all".
